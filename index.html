        <h2>Toe beans!</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone has seen some toe beans in their life, whether they realize
            it or not, and most people agree &mdash; They are simply adorable!<br />
            But there's an age long question that comes with the wonder of these
            magnificent peets:
          <h3>What are toe beans and what makes them so
            irresistible?</h3>
        </p>

          <p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toe_bean" target="_blank"> Wiktionary</a> defines toe beans as <i>&quot;Any of the digital pads of a cat's or a dog's paw.&quot;</i> And if you ask most people, they will agree that the slang term is more commonly known to be used for dogs and cats, but we're not here to look at the facts. <br> In fact, we're here to dive into the meaning of it and question everything about the term. Maybe even our lives.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
          <p><b>So, what defines a toe bean?</b><br>
            Well, if you ask me <span><i>(which you did not)</i></span>, I would say that it is the soft and squishy skin underneath any paw, which would then bring to question if all paws have to beans. Simple answer is <strong>yes.</strong> But to get there, let's have a look at this list of animals that have paws.</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Felids, such as cats and tigers; some of which may have toe tufts.</li>
            <li>Canids, such as dogs and foxes</li>
            <li>Rabbits and other lagomorphs have paws with very sharp nails and have no pads underneath them</li>
            <li>Bears and raccoons</li>
            <li>Weasles and other mustelids</li>
            <li>Rodents</li>
         </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Now comes the section of a lot of sample text that means nothing. So to make it look like there's a lot of bulk text here, have a paragraph of lorem ipsum!</p>
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Sint, reiciendis, ullam optio, asperiores facilis quasi nostrum aut eligendi sed voluptates ipsam vitae dignissimos quaerat?

        <p>All that said, I don't know why you even read through all of this, but I hope you got a good laugh out of it.</p>
